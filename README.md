# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is the 'dev' (development) branch. here I tries to add new feature, fix bugs, optimize code and make it more user friendly. check the [main branch](https://github.com/rahhaly/tic-tac-toe) if you want to try the game.

## TODO

- [x] separate javascript to modules (use MVC mythology & Vite to bundle theme).
- [x] Intro page to choose play option.
- [x] Add return button (don't start round immediately).
- [ ] Add vs AI option alongside vs player option.
